# Initialize

## Overview

These exercises are intended to practice with the concept of initialization. Some of them will require additional methods besides initialize.

## Running the tests

Navigate to the `initialize` folder. Run each test with `ruby test/<class_name>_test.rb`. Work on the tests in alphabetical order beginning with `aardvark_test.rb`, then `beaver_test.rb`, etc.
